# Functional Design Skill

End-to-end UI/UX creation: **spec the function, design the visuals, build the code.**

This skill goes from requirements discovery through working components. It produces functional specifications (state machines, data flows, edge cases), generates a visual design system, creates an HTML preview for approval, then builds actual project files with every state implemented. No more happy-path-only UIs.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning AND building a new feature, screen, or application
- A UI feels "off" but no one can articulate why (usually a functional gap, not a visual one)
- When the spec says "add a dashboard" but nobody has defined what it *does* or how it *looks*
- Refactoring a feature that has grown organically without a coherent interaction model
- When you want working UI code that handles every state — not just the happy path

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Conducting user research or creating personas (use a research skill)
- Performance optimization or backend architecture (use an architecture skill)
- Simple one-off component with clear requirements (just build it directly)

---

## Core Protocol: Eight Phases

**Phases 1-5**: Functional Spec (what it does, how it behaves)
**Phase 6**: Visual Design System (how it looks)
**Phase 7**: Preview (approve before building)
**Phase 8**: Component Implementation (working code)

**RULE: Never skip Phase 1. Never jump to component specs without completing Phase 2. Never write code without completing Phase 6.**

### Phase 1: Functional Discovery

Before any design work, answer these questions. If the user can't answer them, help them figure it out. Do NOT proceed until these are resolved.

#### Mandatory Questions

**Users & Roles**
1. Who uses this? List every distinct user role.
2. For each role: what are their top 3 tasks? (Not features — tasks. "Find overdue invoices" not "Invoice page.")
3. What does each role NEVER need to see or do?

**Data & Domain**
4. What data flows through this interface? Name the core entities.
5. Where does the data come from? (API, local state, user input, real-time stream, file upload)
6. What are the business rules that constrain this data? (e.g., "An order can't be edited after shipping")
7. What's the data volume? (10 items vs. 10,000 vs. infinite scroll)

**Context & Constraints**
8. Where does the user arrive FROM? (Navigation context, deep link, notification, email link)
9. Where do they go AFTER? (Next step in workflow, back to list, external system)
10. What devices/viewport sizes must this work on? Any offline requirements?
11. What's the performance budget? (Time to interactive, acceptable loading time)

**Success Criteria**
12. How do we know this feature is working? (Not metrics — observable user outcomes)
13. What's the worst thing that could go wrong? (Data loss, wrong action taken, confused user)

#### Output: Functional Requirements Brief

```markdown
## Functional Requirements Brief: [Feature Name]

### User Roles
| Role | Top Tasks | Excluded From |
|------|-----------|---------------|

### Core Entities
| Entity | Source | Volume | Business Rules |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|

### Context
- Entry points: [how users arrive]
- Exit points: [where users go next]
- Device requirements: [viewport/offline needs]
- Performance budget: [time constraints]

### Success Criteria
- [Observable outcome 1]
- [Observable outcome 2]

### Risk: What Could Go Wrong
- [Risk 1 and mitigation]
- [Risk 2 and mitigation]
```

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Mapping

With requirements in hand, map the functional architecture.

#### 2A: Screen/View Inventory

List every distinct view the user will encounter. For each:

```markdown
### View: [Name]
- **Purpose**: [One sentence — what the user accomplishes here]
- **Entry conditions**: [What must be true for the user to reach this view]
- **Primary action**: [The #1 thing the user does here]
- **Secondary actions**: [Other things available but not primary]
- **Data requirements**: [What data must be loaded to render this view]
- **Exit points**: [Where the user goes from here]
```

#### 2B: Navigation Architecture

```markdown
### Navigation Tree
- [Root]
  - [Section A]
    - [View A1] — primary action: [...]
    - [View A2] — primary action: [...]
  - [Section B]
    - [View B1] — primary action: [...]

### Navigation Rules
- Deep link support: [which views are directly addressable]
- Back button behavior: [what "back" means in each context]
- Breadcrumb logic: [how the user knows where they are]
- Unsaved changes: [what happens if user navigates away with dirty state]
```

#### 2C: Data Flow Architecture

Reference `references/DATA-FLOW-PATTERNS.md` for pattern selection.

For each data concern, specify:

```markdown
### Data Architecture
| Data | Owner | Cache Strategy | Refresh Trigger | Survives Refresh? |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [Entity list] | Server | Stale-while-revalidate | Navigation, pull-to-refresh | Yes (cache) |
| [Form draft] | Client | Session storage | Manual save | Yes |
| [UI state] | Client | Memory only | — | No |
```

#### 2D: State Management Strategy

Classify every piece of state:

| Category | Examples | Storage | Lifetime |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Server state** | Entity data, user profile | API + cache | Until invalidated |
| **Client state** | Form values, wizard step | Component/store | Until submitted or abandoned |
| **UI state** | Sidebar open, sort order | Memory/URL | Current session or persisted in URL |
| **Derived state** | Filtered list, computed totals | Computed | Recomputed on dependency change |

---

### Phase 3: Behavioral Specification

For each component or feature, produce a behavioral spec.

#### 3A: Component Behavior Specs

Reference `references/STATE-SPECIFICATIONS.md` for state machine templates.

```markdown
### Component: [Name]

**States**: [List all possible states]
**Data In**: [What data this component receives]
**Data Out**: [What events/data this component emits]

| Current State | Event | Guard | Action | Next State |
|--------------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| idle | user clicks edit | hasPermission | enable form fields | editing |
| editing | user clicks save | form.valid | submit to API | submitting |
| editing | user clicks cancel | — | discard changes, confirm if dirty | idle |
| submitting | API success | — | show success feedback | idle |
| submitting | API failure | — | show error, preserve form data | editing |
```

#### 3B: User Flow Maps

Reference `references/USER-FLOW-TEMPLATES.md` for flow frameworks.

For each primary task, map:
1. **Happy path**: The ideal journey from start to completion
2. **Error paths**: Every point where something can fail, and what happens
3. **Edge cases**: Reference the Edge Case Catalog in USER-FLOW-TEMPLATES.md

#### 3C: Non-Happy State Specs

Reference `references/EMPTY-ERROR-LOADING.md` — the most commonly skipped specs.

For every view, specify:

| State | What the User Sees | Available Actions | Tone |
|-------|--------------------|-------------------|------|
| Empty (first run) | [Guidance to get started] | [Primary CTA] | Welcoming, instructional |
| Empty (filtered) | [Explanation + clear filters] | [Clear filters, broaden search] | Helpful |
| Loading (initial) | [Skeleton/spinner spec] | [None or cancel] | — |
| Loading (refresh) | [Preserve content + indicator] | [Continue interacting] | Non-blocking |
| Error (network) | [Offline message] | [Retry, work offline] | Reassuring |
| Error (server) | [Generic error] | [Retry, contact support] | Apologetic |
| Error (permission) | [Access denied] | [Request access, go back] | Factual |

#### 3D: Responsive Behavior Specs

Not layout breakpoints — **functional** differences:

| Breakpoint | Functional Difference |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Mobile | Bulk actions hidden; swipe-to-action replaces hover menus; form fields stack |
| Tablet | Side panel replaces modal for detail views; touch targets enlarged |
| Desktop | Keyboard shortcuts active; hover previews enabled; multi-column layout |

---

### Phase 4: Interaction Design

#### 4A: Microinteraction Specs

Using Dan Saffer's framework (Trigger, Rules, Feedback, Loops & Modes):

```markdown
### Microinteraction: [Name]

**Trigger**: [What initiates this interaction — user action or system event]
**Rules**: [What happens when triggered — the logic]
**Feedback**: [How the user knows something happened — visual, auditory, haptic]
**Loops & Modes**: [Does this repeat? Are there different modes?]
```

#### 4B: Error Flow Architecture

Reference `references/EMPTY-ERROR-LOADING.md` for error state patterns.

Map the complete error flow:

```markdown
### Error Flow: [Feature]

| Failure Point | Error Type | User Impact | Recovery Path | Fallback |
|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| API call | Network timeout | Can't load data | Auto-retry 3x, then manual retry | Show cached data if available |
| Form submit | Validation (client) | Can't proceed | Highlight fields, preserve input | — |
| Form submit | Validation (server) | Can't proceed | Show server errors on fields | — |
| Form submit | Conflict (409) | Stale data | Show diff, let user choose | — |
| Auth | Token expired | Action rejected | Silent refresh, retry action | Redirect to login |
```

#### 4C: Complex Component State Machines

For components with rich interaction (modals, wizards, data tables, inline editors):

Reference `references/STATE-SPECIFICATIONS.md` for compound state patterns.
Reference `references/INTERACTION-PATTERNS.md` for pattern selection guidance.

#### 4D: Transition Intent Specs

Specify what motion **communicates**, not the CSS:

| Transition | Intent | Duration Class |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| View enters | "New content has arrived" | Standard (200-300ms) |
| Item deleted | "This is gone" with undo affordance | Quick (150ms) + undo window |
| Error appears | "Attention needed" | Immediate + subtle pulse |
| Loading → loaded | "Content is ready, here's what changed" | Staggered reveal |

---

### Phase 5: Validation & Handoff

#### 5A: Nielsen's Heuristics Audit

Check the spec against all 10:

| # | Heuristic | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Visibility of system status | | Loading states defined? Progress indicators? |
| 2 | Match between system and real world | | Domain language used? Familiar mental models? |
| 3 | User control and freedom | | Undo/redo? Cancel? Emergency exits? |
| 4 | Consistency and standards | | Same patterns for same actions? |
| 5 | Error prevention | | Confirmation for destructive actions? Constraints that prevent errors? |
| 6 | Recognition rather than recall | | Context visible? Options surfaced? |
| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency | | Power user shortcuts? Customization? |
| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | | Every element serves a purpose? |
| 9 | Help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors | | Error messages actionable? Recovery paths clear? |
| 10 | Help and documentation | | Contextual help? Onboarding? |

#### 5B: Norman's 7 Stages Check

For each primary task, verify the user can:
1. **Form the goal** — Is the task discoverable? Does the user know this is possible?
2. **Form the intention** — Is it clear HOW to start?
3. **Specify the action** — Are the controls obvious?
4. **Execute the action** — Can they physically do it? (Click targets, keyboard access)
5. **Perceive the result** — Is feedback visible and immediate?
6. **Interpret the result** — Does the feedback make sense?
7. **Evaluate the outcome** — Does the user know they succeeded or need to try again?

#### 5C: Developer Handoff Package

```markdown
## Handoff: [Feature Name]

### Behaviors (not obvious from visual design)
- [Behavior 1: e.g., "Table remembers sort order across sessions via URL params"]
- [Behavior 2: e.g., "Form auto-saves draft every 30s to session storage"]

### Edge Cases to Implement
- [ ] First-time user with no data
- [ ] User with 10,000+ items (pagination/virtualization required)
- [ ] Concurrent edit by another user
- [ ] Session expiry during multi-step flow
- [ ] Browser back button during unsaved changes

### Data Requirements
| Endpoint/Query | When Called | Cache Behavior | Error Handling |
|---------------|------------|----------------|----------------|

### QA Checklist
- [ ] All empty states render correctly
- [ ] All error states render correctly
- [ ] Loading states don't flash (minimum display time if data loads fast)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all primary actions
- [ ] Screen reader announces state changes
- [ ] Back button behavior matches spec
- [ ] Deep links resolve to correct view state
```

---

### Phase 6: Visual Design System

Reference `references/VISUAL-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` for design token generation and component styling anatomy.

#### 6A: Detect Existing Project

Before generating anything visual, read the project:

1. **Package manager**: Read `package.json` (or equivalent) for framework and styling dependencies
2. **Theme config**: Read `tailwind.config.ts/js`, `theme.ts`, CSS custom properties, or equivalent
3. **Global styles**: Read `index.css`, `global.css`, or equivalent base styles
4. **Existing components**: Scan shared/common component directory for established patterns (button variants, cards, badges)

**If existing design system found**: ADOPT it. Only fill gaps (missing states, missing components). Present: "I found your existing design system. Here's what I'll use and what I'll add."

**If no existing design system**: Generate opinionated defaults using VISUAL-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md, then present for approval: "Here's the design system I'll use. Want to adjust anything?"

#### 6B: Generate Design Tokens

Produce a complete token set:

- **Colors**: Surface hierarchy (5 levels), accent + hover + muted, semantic (success/warning/error/info) + muted variants, border colors
- **Typography**: Font families (UI + mono), size scale, weight scale, line heights
- **Spacing**: Base unit (4px), scale, density mode (compact/comfortable/spacious)
- **Borders**: Radius scale, border colors, focus ring
- **Motion**: Duration scale (instant/fast/standard/slow), easing functions, animation definitions

#### 6C: Define Component Styles

For each component type needed by the spec (from Phases 2-4):

- **Buttons**: Variants, sizes, all states (default/hover/active/focus/disabled/loading)
- **Cards**: Variants (KPI, content, status-decorated, clickable)
- **Badges**: Status color mapping, sizes, pulse for active states
- **Tables**: Header, row, hover, sort indicators, responsive behavior
- **Forms**: Input, label, help text, error text, disabled state
- **Navigation**: Active, hover, inactive, mobile collapse
- **Skeletons**: Match loaded content layout exactly
- **Empty states**: Centered layout with icon, heading, description, CTA
- **Error states**: Banner, inline, full-page variants
- **Toasts**: Success/error/warning/info variants, positioning, auto-dismiss

#### Output: Design System Document

Present the design system to the user for confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Phase 7: Preview Generation

#### 7A: Generate HTML Preview

Create a single self-contained HTML file that shows the entire UI:

1. **All views** from Phase 2A, rendered with the design system from Phase 6
2. **State switcher** — tabs or toggles to view each screen in different states (loaded, empty, loading, error)
3. **Responsive preview** — viewport toggle for mobile/tablet/desktop
4. **Real-looking data** — use realistic placeholder data, not "Lorem ipsum" or "Test 123"
5. **All component variants** — show buttons, cards, badges, tables in their various states

The preview uses inline CSS mirroring the design tokens. No external dependencies.

#### 7B: User Review

Save the preview to the project (e.g., `planning/ui-preview.html`). The user opens it in a browser and reviews.

- **Approved**: Proceed to Phase 8
- **Adjustments requested**: Loop back to Phase 6 (design tokens) or Phase 3 (behavior) as needed. Regenerate preview.

---

### Phase 8: Component Implementation

Reference `references/COMPONENT-GENERATION.md` for component templates, framework detection, and generation checklist.

#### 8A: Detect Project Stack

Read project files to determine:
- **Framework**: React / Angular / Vue / Svelte / vanilla (from package.json)
- **Styling**: Tailwind / CSS Modules / CSS-in-JS / Sass / vanilla CSS
- **File organization**: Feature-based / type-based / flat (from existing component structure)
- **Existing patterns**: How existing components handle state, data fetching, routing

ALWAYS match existing conventions. Never impose new patterns on an existing project.

#### 8B: Generate Shared Components

Build the component library first (these are used by every page):

1. **Button** — all variants/sizes/states from Phase 6C
2. **Card** — KPI, content, status, clickable variants
3. **Badge/Status** — status color mapping, pulse for active
4. **DataTable** — sortable, filterable, URL-synced, with skeleton/empty/error states
5. **Form elements** — input, select, checkbox, toggle with validation display
6. **Skeleton** — variants matching each component's loaded layout
7. **EmptyState** — configurable icon, title, description, CTA
8. **ErrorState** — banner, inline, full-page variants with retry
9. **Toast system** — queue-based, auto-dismiss, positioned
10. **Layout shell** — sidebar, header, content area, mobile responsive

#### 8C: Generate Page Components

For each view from Phase 2A:

1. **Data fetching** — wire to endpoints from Phase 5C using SWR polling hook
2. **State handling** — implement all states from Phase 3A state machines
3. **All visual states** — loading skeleton, empty state, error state, loaded, refreshing
4. **Responsive behavior** — from Phase 3D breakpoint specs
5. **Microinteractions** — from Phase 4A specs
6. **Accessibility** — semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

#### 8D: Generate Hooks/Services

1. **SWR polling hook** — with tab visibility pause, configurable interval, stale data preservation
2. **URL state hook** — sync filters/sort/pagination to URL params
3. **Form state hook** — dirty tracking, validation, navigate-away warning
4. **Toast hook** — add/remove/auto-dismiss toast notifications

#### 8E: Wire It Together

1. **Router** — route definitions matching Phase 2B navigation architecture
2. **Layout** — shell wrapping all routes
3. **Data flow** — hooks connected to components, polling configured per Phase 2E

#### Output: Working project files

Files are written directly into the project's source tree following existing organization conventions.

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

**NEVER do these:**

### Functional Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Skip Phase 1, jump to components | You'll build the wrong thing beautifully | Complete Functional Discovery first |
| Happy-path-only specs | 60% of user time is spent in non-happy states | Spec empty, loading, error, and edge states for EVERY view |
| Components without state machines | Leads to undiscovered states and broken transitions | Every interactive component gets a state table |
| Forms without validation timing | "When does the red border appear?" is always asked too late | Specify: on blur, on submit, real-time, or on field exit |
| "Show an error message" | Which error? What does it say? What can the user do about it? | Spec the error type, message content, recovery action, and fallback |
| Infinite scroll by default | Doesn't work with keyboard nav, deep links, or "I was on page 3" | Choose pagination pattern deliberately (see DATA-FLOW-PATTERNS.md) |
| Modal for everything | Modals block context; most content doesn't need isolation | Use INTERACTION-PATTERNS.md decision trees |
| "Responsive" means "stack columns" | Mobile users have different TASKS, not just smaller screens | Spec functional differences per breakpoint |

### Visual Design Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Rainbow syndrome | Too many colors overwhelms and confuses hierarchy | 1 accent + 4 semantic colors max |
| Inconsistent radius | Mixing rounded-sm, rounded-md, rounded-lg randomly | Pick 1-2 radius values and use them consistently |
| Font-size soup | 8 different sizes on one screen destroys hierarchy | Max 4 sizes per screen (xs, sm, base, lg/xl) |
| Shadow inflation | Heavy shadows on every element | Dark: use surface levels. Light: shadows only for elevation changes |
| Hardcoded colors in components | Changes require editing every file | Use design tokens everywhere — never raw hex in components |
| Skeleton that doesn't match content | Generic gray blocks confuse instead of inform | Skeletons must match the EXACT layout of loaded content |
| Empty table with headers | Showing column headers over nothing looks broken | Replace with centered empty state: icon + message + CTA |
| Animations on everything | Overwhelming, distracting, performance killer | Animate state changes and entrances only. Never > 500ms. |
| Color as only indicator | Colorblind users can't distinguish states | Always pair color with icon, text, or shape |
